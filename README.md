### Project Overview 
------
Excel learning involves acquiring skills to effectively use Microsoft Excel for tasks like data entry, analysis, and visualization. It typically covers:
      Basic Functions: Understanding the interface, entering data, and using simple formulas (e.g., SUM, AVERAGE).
      Data Manipulation: Learning to sort, filter, and format data to make it more readable.
      Advanced Functions: Utilizing more complex formulas and functions (e.g., VLOOKUP, IF statements) for data analysis.
      Charts and Graphs: Creating visual representations of data to identify trends and insights.
      Pivot Tables: Summarizing large datasets for quick analysis and reporting.


### Data Sources
There are many great resources available for learning Excel. Here are some popular options:
Online Courses: Coursera, Udemy, Linkedin Learning and Yutube Channels


### Tools used

  - Microsoft Excel Application: [download here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ng/)

  Learning Microsoft Excel can open up a wide range of possibilities, both personally and professionally. Here are some key areas where Excel skills can be beneficial:

   1. For Data Cleansing
   2. For Data Analysis
   3. For creating a Pivot table
   4. For Automation
   5. For Financial Modeling
   6. For Project Management
   7. For Reporting
   8. For Automation
   9. For Inventory Management
   10. For Data Entry and Tracking

- SQL- (Structured query Language): [download here](http://www.microsoft.com/sql-sever-download)

Learning SQL (Structured Query Language) can open up a wide range of possibilities, especially in the field of data management, analysis, and application development. Here are some key areas where SQL knowledge can be applied:

1. Database Management
Querying Databases: SQL is used to retrieve data from relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and Oracle. You can perform basic queries (SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, etc.) to fetch data.
Inserting, Updating, and Deleting Data: You can modify data in a database using SQL commands (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
Creating and Managing Database Structures: SQL allows you to create databases and tables, define columns, set data types, and specify relationships between tables.
Indexes and Constraints: You can create indexes for better query performance and set constraints to maintain data integrity (like PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, etc.).
2. Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis: SQL is a powerful tool for analyzing large datasets, summarizing data using aggregation functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG, GROUP BY), and filtering results.
Advanced Queries: Learn how to use JOINs, subqueries, window functions, and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to perform complex data analysis.
Business Intelligence: SQL is a fundamental skill in BI tools like Power BI, Tableau, and Looker. These tools allow users to visualize data and create dashboards, often querying databases directly with SQL.

- PowerBI Is a Data viewsualization tool

### Data Cleaning And Preparation

In the initial phase of Data Cleaning and preparation, we performed the following actions;

-Data Loading and Inpection
- Handling missing variables
- Data Cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA Involves exploring the data to answer some questions about the data such as;

- What is the overall revenue for each region?
- What arethe models for peak sales?
- Which store has the lowest unit?

### Data Analysis

Here we included some basic line of codes and functions used during our Analysis;

- Basic Excel Functions
- Activated a pivot Table command
- Created a chart to visualize the sales

  ### Data Visualization
