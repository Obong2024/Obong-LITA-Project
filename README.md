### Project Overview 
------
The goal of this project is to gather and analyze data from diverse regions, stores, and markets to deliver actionable insights that guide business strategies, boost operational efficiency, and enhance customer satisfaction. Understanding key metrics like revenue, units sold, and transaction categories across various regions and stores is essential for driving business decisions and optimizing performance. By systematically collecting and analyzing this data, the project offers valuable insights into sales trends, product performance, and market dynamics over time.


### Project Objectives
------

The objectives of this project were defined to accomplish the following analytical goals:
- Data Collection: Gather comprehensive data on revenue, units sold, and transaction categories across different stores and regions.
- Trend Analysis: Examine historical data to uncover trends and patterns in revenue, unit sales, and transaction types over designated timeframes.
- Performance Metrics: Define key performance indicators (KPIs) to assess sales performance and track growth across product categories.
- Reporting: Create detailed reports that encapsulate the findings and offer strategic recommendations based on the analysis.


### Data Sources
------

The data sources consist of the following key elements:
1.	Revenue: Refers to the total income generated from sales transactions.
2.	Units Sold: Indicates the number of products sold during a specific time period.
3.	Region: Denotes the geographical areas where the stores are located.
4.	Market: Refers to specific segments within a larger region, capturing various demographics and economic conditions.
5.	Transaction Category: Classifies sales transactions into different types (e.g., online, in-store, returns) to analyze customer behavior and assess the performance of sales channels.
6.	Store: Represents individual retail locations or outlets.
7.	Trade Date: Indicates the date on which transactions took place.
8.	Fiscal Period: Represents the timeframes used for financial reporting (such as quarters or months) to assess performance against budgets and forecasts.
9.	Model: Refers to the specific type or brand of products available for sale.
10.	Line of Business: Represents the various sectors or categories under which products or services are categorized.
11.	Day: Indicates the specific days of the week when transactions occur.
12.	Category: Classifies products based on shared characteristics or functions.

#### Note that; 
These datasets offer a holistic perspective on sales performance, customer behavior, and market dynamics, facilitating informed decision-making.


### Key Performance Metrics
------

(i) Revenue: This is the total sales income generated from various regions and stores.

(ii) Units Sold: This refers to total quantity of units of products sold at a specific period across different regions and stores.

(iii) Transaction Categories: This is simply the classification of transactions to analyze customer purchasing behavior.


### Used Tools
---------


### Microsoft Excel: [download here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ng/)

- Pivot Tables: Used for summarizing data and deriving insights related to revenue, units sold, and transaction categories.
- Formulas and Functions: Essential for calculating performance metrics and automating tasks such as sorting and filtering data.
- Data Visualizations (Charts and Graphs): Employed to produce visual representations of trends, comparisons, and critical insights.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involves examining the data to address various questions, such as:
- What is the total revenue generated in each region?
- Which models experience the highest sales?
- Which store has the lowest number of units sold?


### Data Aalysis
-------

- Activated the pivot table command
- Created a chart to visualize the sales


### Data Visualization
Here we had to picture revenue geerated by Region
